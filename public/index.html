      </h3>

      <p>SimplePass is a password manager that stores and encrypts your passwords in Google Drive. Your data never touches a 3rd party server.</p>

      <h3>
        <a id="what-is-simplepass" class="anchor" href="#what-is-simplepass" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?
      </h3>

      <p>Everyone should be using some form of password manager. They provide a central location to audit and keep track of your passwords. They also help to keep you more secure by promoting better security practices such as using longer and more complex passwords.</p>

      <p>Simple pass also stores your information in a format that is similar to storing data in a Google Doc or Spreadsheet, allowing you to sort, search, and add "child" rows. This allows for a clean and practical way to store access credentials for just about anything.</p>

      </h3>

      <p>Most existing password managers add an additional item to your every day workflow. Usually it is another login and account to keep track of, or at the very least another application to install on your already full harddrive. They are also usually very feature rich, providing more than necessary to manage your passwords.</p>

      <p>SimplePass is a minimalistic approach to storing your passwords and it coincides with your existing workflow by integrating with Google Drive. Simply create a new row, fill it out, and when you need to login to an application return to SimplePass and click the "copy" button to copy your password to the clipboard.</p>

      <p><strong><i>It's a good idea to clear your clipboard as often as possible if it is storing passwords</i></strong></p>

      </h3>
           
      <p>Normally it would be a bad idea to rely on a 3rd party cloud service to store all your personal passwords. Fortunately, when it comes to security, Google is mostly reliable, if Google is hacked, we have bigger problems anyways.</p>

      <p>The passwords are also stored in Drive with AES encryption, so even if your Google account is compromised, it would be difficult to decrypt your stored passwords.</p>

      <p>The application is hosted on an SSL encrypted server and the application itself has no server side component, so none of your crucial data is stored in the memory of a 3rd party server. All communications are directly between the front-end and Google Drive.</p>

      <strong><i>It is a good idea to enable 2 Factor Authentication for the master Google account that will be utilizing SimplePass</i></strong>
